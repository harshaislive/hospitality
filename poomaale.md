POO - MAALE (GARLAND OF FLOWERS)

Poomaale Collective
The Poomaale Collective, a 300+ acre landscape, nestled in the Brahmagiri foothills encompasses three hillocks and three perennial streams.

Impact Unveiled: Poomaale's eco-conscious practices have triggered a significant environmental revolution. Notably, over 3 years, the estate has conserved an astounding 60 million liters of water and avoided the usage of 400 Tons of chemical fertilizers as compared to conventional methods.

Eco-Friendly Coffee: This journey encompasses coffee cultivation. Grown with minimal human intervention, devoid of fertilizers and irrigation, the beans undergo specialized fermentation, achieving an unprecedented 90 on a cupping scale, a first for robusta coffee in India.

Biodiversity Rebirth: The estate now hosts seven species of woodpeckers, endemic species like dancing frogs, and the elusive Nilgiri martens (only a 1000 left in the wild). Our commitment to conservation contributes to the restoration of the Western Ghats' unique biodiversity while being financially viable.

Balancing Act: Poomaale serves as a stellar example of ecological balance and sustainability. We strive to protect and restore this region, one of the world's biodiversity hotspots. A benchmark of sustainable development!
